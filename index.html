  <h1>Project Euler - Problem 2</h1>
  <p>Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2,
    the first 10 terms will be:</p>
  <p>1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...</p>
  <h3>By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the
    even-valued terms.</h3>

  <h2>The solution is: <span id="solution">?</span></h2>

    // Get the Fibonacci sequence starting with 1 and 2 with a max value of 4000000
    const fibonacciSequenceGenerator = new FibonacciSequenceGenerator(1, 2, 4000000)
    const terms = fibonacciSequenceGenerator.generate()

    // Get all even terms from the Fibonacci sequence
    const evenTerms = terms.filter(t => t % 2 === 0)
    const reducer = (accumulator, currentValue) => currentValue + accumulator

    // Get the sum of all even terms
    const sum = evenTerms.reduce(reducer)
